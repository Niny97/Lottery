# Lottery

Lottery is a game where user selects 7 different numbers and then compares them with the numbers that computer choses, to look for matching numbers. It only allows you to play if your age is 18 years or more.


The goal of the project was to write a first working program from head to toe following a simple diagram and to learn the use of coding basics such as use of variables, branching, loops and a simple library for random numbers.
  
USAGE:

The application was made on and for Windows 10 platform using Visual Studio 2019. The project contains the executable for running the application (EXE folder), Visual Studio 2019 solution and the source code. 

When testing on another Windows machine apart from the one on which it was developed, it was found that running the .exe files sometimes doesn't work on the first try so the user needs to try again until the game can be played. The source code is also present so the user can also manually rebuild the program.
